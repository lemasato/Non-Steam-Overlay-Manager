### How do I use it?  
1. Head to the [releases](https://github.com/lemasato/Non-Steam-Overlay-Manager/releases) tab to download the latest NSO-Manager.exe.  
1. Then, simply run the executable to set up your profiles and settings. When finished, head to your Steam library.  
1. Add the executable as a non-steam game. Right click on it in your library > Properties. Click on "Set launch options".  
1. Put in: /Profile="Profile Name". For example, if your profile name is "Final Fantasy", use: /Profile="Final Fantasy".  
1. Click on "Ok". Feel free to rename the shortcut as you wish.  
1. Run the tool from your library.  

To add another game, the steps from 3-6.  

### Does it really work for any game?  
It does. As long as your game is not running in fullscreen (borderless is fine).  
You simply need to tick the "Use External Overlay" checkbox.  

Once in game, press your "External Overlay shortcut" hotkey to bring it up.  
If the window is black (without the Steam Overlay showing up), that means that you either did not provide the right shortcut that you normally use to toggle the Steam Overlay or that the tool failed to correctly send the inputs to the External Overlay. To fix it, simply press the keys you normally use to toggle the Steam Overlay (Shift+Tab by default).
