v0.1.1 (24 Dec 2017)
	Changes:
	- The ExternalOverlay executable is now using Unity. It has also been renamed to "NSO Overlay.exe"
	This results in a smaller file (from 42mb to 12mb), as well as less memory usage (from ~360mb to ~70mb).
	I'm sure improvements can still be done but I'm very unfamiliar with DirectX Apps, let alone Unity.
	- Any field referring to "External Overlay" has been changed to "NSO Overlay".
	
	- Minor modifications to the tool's icon.
	
	Fixes:
	- Assets would not extract correctly when using the ahk source.

v0.1 (21 Dec 2017):
