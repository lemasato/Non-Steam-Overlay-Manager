-----------------------
v0.2.6 (04 Apr 2018)
	Features:
	- Added a setting to allow the NSO Overlay shortcut to work with all windows, instead of just the game's window.
	
	Changes:
	- Updated some tooltips, and tray tips.
	
	Fixes:
	- Would be unable to start profiles that use a game from the Windows Store.
	This is because the shortcut (.lnk) file for the game does not specify a path and therefore does not allow us to run it ourselves to retrieve the game's PID and executable name.
	Upon running such a profile, NSO Manager will not be able to close itself automatically upon game closure.	
	Additionally, if the "Use NSO Overlay" setting is enabled, the NSO Overlay shortcut will be forced to function on all windows.

-----------------------
v0.2.5 (23 Feb 2018)
	Changes:
	- Added the WinStore Workaround as part of the tool, until I can get to work on a proper solution.
	It can be found at "Documents\AutoHotkey\NSO Manager\resources\WinStore Workaround\ApplicationFrameHost.exe
	
	If you need help getting it to work, head to the main page of the GitHub repository and scroll down to the README section.

-----------------------
v0.2.4 (23 Feb 2018)
	It has come to my attention that this tool is NOT compatible with WinStore Games.
	This is because, when creating a shortcut for said games, their "Field" does not point to the game executable.
	For this reason, until I can work on improvements, I have created a small side app that will help you having the NSO Overlay on such games.
	You can find more infos about it over issue #8.
	
	Changes:
	- When the "NSO Overlay" setting is enabled, the tray tip will now show the real hotkey string.
	(Back then, having the key bound to CTRL+F1 would show "^F1" as "^" correspdonds to the CTRL modifier. It will now correctly show as "CTRL+F1")
	
	Fixes:
	- The source had been converted into a 64bits executable instead of a 32bits one.
	(This tool was never meant to be x64 only compatible).
	This means NSO Manager is now compatible with 32bits OS.
	- Having a "=" sign in the "Launch parameters:" field would wrongfully empty the field.
	- Upon checking update, the clipboard content would be wrongfully changed.

-----------------------
v0.2.3 (29 Jan 2018)
	Improvements:
	- Minor GUI changes.
	- Improved the way the Steam Overlay shortcut "key-combination string" is sent to the NSO Overlay window.
	
	Features:
	- Added launch parameters.
	These are only applied to the file launched by NSO Manager.
	If, for example, you are using a game that has a launcher, the parameters will only be applied to the game launcher executable.
	- Added compatibility for shortcut (lnk) files.
	- Pressing the ESC key while on the NSO Overlay will toggle it off.
	
	Changes:
	- Added links to Github and Discord on the GUI.
	
	Fixes:
	- When not using a launcher, NSO Manager would instantly exit after running the client executable.
	- F1 would be forced as the hotkey to toggle the NSO Overlay.

-----------------------
v0.2.1 (12 Jan 2018)
	Fixes:
	- The "profile invalid" message box would appear at all times, making the user unable to modify profiles.
	- A profile named "0" would always be created upon creating a new profile.
	If you had the "0" profile, it will automatically be deleted.
	- Users would be unable to run a profile which had the "Launcher" setting disabled.

-----------------------
v0.2 (27 Dec 2017)
	Features:
	- A warning box will appear if your game is running elevated while Steam is not.
	Info: Having the game elevated but not Steam will causes the Steam Overlay to be unable to hook to your game (or our NSO Overlay).
	- A warning box will appear if the Steam Overlay fails to hook to our NSO Overlay.
	
	Changes:
	- The "ExternalOverlay" executable is now using Unity. It has also been renamed to "NSO Overlay"
	This results in a smaller file (from 42mb to 12mb), as well as less memory usage (from ~360mb to ~70mb).
	I'm sure improvements can still be done but I'm very unfamiliar with DirectX Apps, let alone Unity.
	- Any field referring to "External Overlay" has been updated to "NSO Overlay".
	Your local .ini files will automatically be updated accordingly.
	- Minor modifications to the icon.
	
	Fixes:
	- Assets would not extract correctly when using the ahk source.
	- Profile settings could be changed without any profile being selected.
	This would cause invalid profile (such as [0],[1] or [Profiles]) names to be written to the Profiles.ini file.
	- The checkbox settings would retrieve the profile name from the "Name:" edit field, instead of from the profiles list.

-----------------------
v0.1 (21 Dec 2017):
	- Initially published on GitHub.
