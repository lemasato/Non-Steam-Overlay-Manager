-----------------------
v0.2.1 (12 Jan 2018)
	Fixes:
	- The "profile invalid" message box would appear at all times, making the user unable to modify profiles.
	- A profile named "0" would always be created upon creating a new profile.
	If you had the "0" profile, it will automatically be deleted.
	- Users would be unable to run a profile which had the "Launcher" setting disabled.

-----------------------
v0.2 (27 Dec 2017)
	Features:
	- A warning box will appear if your game is running elevated while Steam is not.
	Info: Having the game elevated but not Steam will causes the Steam Overlay to be unable to hook to your game (or our NSO Overlay).
	- A warning box will appear if the Steam Overlay fails to hook to our NSO Overlay.
	
	Changes:
	- The "ExternalOverlay" executable is now using Unity. It has also been renamed to "NSO Overlay"
	This results in a smaller file (from 42mb to 12mb), as well as less memory usage (from ~360mb to ~70mb).
	I'm sure improvements can still be done but I'm very unfamiliar with DirectX Apps, let alone Unity.
	- Any field referring to "External Overlay" has been updated to "NSO Overlay".
	Your local .ini files will automatically be updated accordingly.
	- Minor modifications to the icon.
	
	Fixes:
	- Assets would not extract correctly when using the ahk source.
	- Profile settings could be changed without any profile being selected.
	This would cause invalid profile (such as [0],[1] or [Profiles]) names to be written to the Profiles.ini file.
	- The checkbox settings would retrieve the profile name from the "Name:" edit field, instead of from the profiles list.

v0.1 (21 Dec 2017):
